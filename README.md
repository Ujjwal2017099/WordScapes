<h2>Brief Explanation of working : </h2>
<li> This application is using tesseract-OCR for extracting text from image.
<li> Then the text generated is converted into a matrix.
<li> The words are also seperated and gets stored in a 2-D array.
<li> Then a Trie Data Structure is being used to search the words in the matrix.  
  
><li> This is very good example of using Data Structures in real world projects.
